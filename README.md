# HI!
I should've made this earlier oh well

Anyway yeah uhhhhh here's my AoC solutions for 2023, I tried in previous years to do it in both Haskell and Python but I'm giving up on Haskell this year because python is my baby and I love it very much

# I'm gonna put some notes on things I found particularly noteworthy below hold on
## Day 1
regex my beloved, I wanted to do some funky stuff with reversing arbitrary regexes to get the numbers back to front but then I remembered findall exists oop
## Day 2
HOLY STR.SPLIT MY ABSOLUTE BELOVED it's a good func to apply like 3 times in a row bc of how standard the format is for lots of AoC challenges
## Day 3
Please do not look at this I hate neighbour functions
## Day 4
This was funky, I originally wanted to do it just adding to a queue but that had Evil space and time complexity but then O(n) in both solution with dicts hallelujah
## Day 5
I'm so sad the numbers are big here, I had a nice class to represent a mapping and a beautiful function that joined them (a -> b ++ b -> c => a -> c) but that wanted a value in the mapping for each value and yeah that's way too big lmao my computer nearly exploded


if you wanna ask about these or tell me "you suck you should've just done blah blah blah" and make me cry, add me on discord melia0294
